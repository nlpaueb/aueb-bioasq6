## ABCNN: Attention-Based Convolutional Neural Network for Modeling Sentence Pairs

This is the implementation of a state-of-the-art model proposed in [ABCNN: Attention-Based Convolutional Neural Network for Modeling Sentence Pairs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.05193).

For our experiments we used [Taeuk Kim's(galsang)](https://github.com/galsang/ABCNN) implementation in tensorflow. The model was also modified in order to be able to run experiments for BioASQ dataset.
